Creating a new timesheet module for your Odoo portal is an excellent way to offer more functionality and convenience to your users. With the module, users can easily log their time, track progress, and keep track of project milestones.


The module can be integrated into your Odoo portal, allowing users to access it directly from the website. It can also be set up for easy access from mobile devices, which can be a great asset for employees who are always on the go.


The module should be intuitive and easy to use, with a user-friendly interface. Automated reminders can be included to help users stay on top of their timesheets and make sure they are up to date. Data collected by the module can be used to track overall time usage, allowing you to spot any issues quickly and take action to correct them.


The module should be secure and robust, to protect user data and ensure its accuracy. Proper testing should be done before launch, to make sure everything works as expected and there are no bugs.


Overall, a timesheet module for your Odoo portal can be a great way to offer more functionality and convenience to your users. With the right implementation, it can be a powerful tool for both you and your users.
