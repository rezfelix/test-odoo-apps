   <p>To use the employee certificate module with signatures of CEO and HR manager, follow these steps:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p>The employee should fill out a request form for a certificate, which should include their personal information and the purpose of the certificate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>The HR manager should review the request form and verify the employee's employment status and the purpose of the certificate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>The CEO should sign the certificate, indicating that the employee has met the requirements for the certificate and that the certificate is valid.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>After the certificate is signed, the module should generate a QR code that contains the certificate information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>The certificate information and QR code should be stored in a secure database accessible only to the employee manager.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>The employee manager should be able to access the certificate database and verify the authenticity of the certificate by scanning the QR code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>The certificate information and QR code should be made available to the public, but only the employee manager should have access to edit or delete the certificate information.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>By following these steps, the employee certificate module with signatures of CEO and HR manager can ensure the authenticity of the employee's certificate and make it accessible to the public for verification.</p>
